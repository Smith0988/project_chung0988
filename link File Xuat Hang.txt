Dear valued customer,

Thank you for purchasing from us. We sincerely apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

Due to the low value of the order, we have chosen to use USPS shipping without tracking to save costs for both sellers and buyers. Occasionally, errors from USPS may cause the package not to reach the customer, making it difficult for us to track the order's location.

Typically, orders are delivered within 10 days. If you do not receive your package within this time frame, we will either resend the item or issue a 100% refund based on your preference.

Please let us know if you would prefer a refund or a new shipment.

Thank you very much, and we look forward to continuing to serve you!
