I Brake for Animals
I Brake for Possums
I brake for America's only native marsupial
Eat Fast Live Trash
It's Called Trash Can Not Trash Can't
Don't Be A Part of The Problem Be The Whole Problem
Embrace the Chaos
I Can Show You Some Trash
You've Yee'd Your Last Haw Partner
Hang in There It Get Worse
Please Let Me Merge Before I Start Crying
I am Very Stressed
The Hell I Won't
My Other Car is A Sled Pulled by 58 Possums
Don't Honk At Me I'll Cry
Live Ugly Fake Your Death
Warning Driver is Feral
Surviving Purely Out of Spite
