This Tiny Turtle He Judges You Immensely
I Slow Down for Tailgaters
Think This is Slow Wait Until I Go Uphill
Please Do Not Tailgate
Tailgating is Small dick Behavior
Hit Me I Need The Money
Feel Free to Pass Me
Yes I See You! No I Won't Speed Up!
don't forget to smile 
I Brake for Turtles
I'm Not Slow You're Just Impatient
Moving As Fast As I Can
Your Speed Doesn't Matter Forward Is Forward
You are Turtley Awesome
keep going
Living The Slow Life
Save The Turtles!
I Love My Turtle
