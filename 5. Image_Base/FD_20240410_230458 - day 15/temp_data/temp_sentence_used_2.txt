try that in a small town
I'm Not Gay But My Boyfriend Is
I'm not gay but my husband is
I'm Not Gay But My Butt Is
save the baby humans
motorcycles are everywhere
my body my choice
love one another
god bless texas
keep your laws off my body
think while its still legal
honk if you think i'm sexy
no human being is illegal
i never lose i either win or learn
The Closer You Get, The Slower I Go
Honk If You Love Jesus
my son is in the air force
wishing i was fishing
i'm so gay i cant even drive straight
i park like an idiot
be the person your dog thinks you are
have courage and be kind
that's what she said
