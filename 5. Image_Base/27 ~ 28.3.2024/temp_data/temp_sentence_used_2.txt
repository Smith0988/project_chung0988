What Goes Around Comes Around
at Least All This Trauma Made Me Hilarious
You're Going to Reap What You sow
Pain is Inevitable, Suffering is Optional
Dust in The Wind
Daddy's Money but I'm Daddy
My Favorite People Call Me Dad
I'm Not Judging I'm Assessing
Shit Could be Worse
Only Ugly People Tailgate Me
Sorry Officer I Thought You Wanted to Race
Never Underestimate a Girl with a Hockey
No Excuses Just Results
God's Children are Not for Sale
I Workout Because Punching People is Frowned Upon
Make America Decent Again
It's only Illegal if You get Caught
Life is Short and So Am I
I'm here to Lay Pipe!
Wag More Bark Less
