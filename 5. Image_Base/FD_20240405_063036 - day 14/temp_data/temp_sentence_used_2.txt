the mountains are calling
suck it up buttercup
on wednesdays we wear pink
if you aint first youre last
honk if you're gay
be kind to animals
crazy cat lady
give peace a chance
one nation under god
i stand for the flag and kneel for the cross
for god so loved the world
If I Passed You On The Right You'r an Idiot
make racists afraid again
make tea not war
don't text and drive
mental health awareness
hate has no home here
please let me merge before i start crying
hate will not make us great
i love jet noise
save the whales
we brake for nobody
women for trump
