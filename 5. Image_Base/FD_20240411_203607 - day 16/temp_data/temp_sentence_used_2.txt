my dog is a democrat
try that in a small town
the mountains are calling and i must go
i voted for trump
proud army sister
it's always sunny
this machine kills fascists
a womans place is in the resistance
facts don't care about your feelings
trump won get over it
thank you truckers
to all the boys I've loved before
his favorite her favorite
i'm a dog too
My Dog Thinks I'm Cool
Two Things I do Well, Make Dogs Happy and Piss People Off
If I Can't Bring My Dog I'm Not Going
you know what I Like About People? Their Dogs
I'm Only Talking To My Dog Today
My Dogs and I Talk Shit About You
My Dog Isn't Spoiled, I'm Just Well Trained
The More People I Meet The More I Like My Dog
Vet Tech Degree in Progress
Sounds Gay, I'm in
You Get Off Your Damn Phone
My Dog Tilts His Head The Same
House Is Not A Home without a baset hound
House Is Not A Home without a dug
we can do it
we can do hard things
