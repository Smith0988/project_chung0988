Here's Looking at You, Kid.
Watch Out for The Idiot Behind Me
Too Loud Too Bad
Keep honking, I'm Deaf!
Yes It's Fast No You Can't Ride it
My Brakes are Good How is Your Insurance
Don't Follow me, I'm Lost!
I'm not Losing Hair I'm Getting Head!
I Wish I Could Text My Dog
I Don't Care What The Bible Says
Praise The Lord
Iâ€™m Here Because You Broke Something
Hold My Beer and Watch This!
If My Music is Too Loud You're Too Old
I Will Not Comply
When in Earth's History Did Climate Not Change
IF You're NOT Outraged, You're NOT PAYING Attention
Thoughts & Prayers - Policy & Change
I specifically Requested The Opposite of This
Work Hard Millions on Welfare Depend on You
There is Power in the Name of Jesus
No Baby On Board So Please Feel Free to Run Into Me
