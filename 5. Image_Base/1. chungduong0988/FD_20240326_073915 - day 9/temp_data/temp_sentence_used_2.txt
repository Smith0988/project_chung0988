My Favorite People Call Me Dad
I Workout Because Punching People is Frowned Upon
God's Children are Not for Sale
Sorry Officer I Thought You Wanted to Race
Never Underestimate a Girl with a Hockey Stick
I'm here to Lay Pipe!
You're Going to Reap What You sow
Shit Could be Worse
Dust in The Wind
It's a Wonderful Life, Everytime a Bell Rings
Only Ugly People Tailgate Me
at Least All This Trauma Made Me Hilarious
Personal Torture Instructor I Mean personal trainer
It's just a Flesh Wound
Life is Short and So Am I
What Goes Around Comes Around
I'm Not Judging I'm Assessing
No Excuses Just Results
If You Honk at me I Will KMS
It's only Illegal if You get Caught
Pain is Inevitable, Suffering is Optional
Debate Team We Have Issues
Sorry for Driving The Speed Limit Some of Us Have warrants!
