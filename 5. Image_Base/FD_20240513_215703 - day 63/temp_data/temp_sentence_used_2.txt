Tough Times Don't Last. Tough People Do
I Slow Down for Tailgaters
Sorry for Driving So Close in Front of You
Keep Tailgating I'm Reloading
Please Do Not Tailgate
Tailgating is Small dick Behavior
Hit Me, I Need The Money
Feel Free to Pass Me
I'm Not to Blame for The Speed Limit Feel Free to Pass Me
The Speed Limit Do Not Tailgate

Yes I See You! No I Won't Speed Up!
YES It's Fast. NO You Can't Drive IT
I Brake for TAILGATERS
This Vehicle Makes Wide Right Turns
This Vehicle Makes Frequent Stops
This Vehicle Does Not Turn Right on Red

Your Speed Doesn't Matter Forward Is Forward
Yes Officer I Did See The Speed Limit. I just Didn't See You
