bestie let me merge
i stand with israel
driver it like you stole it
I Might Be Slow But at Least I'm Ahead of You
normalize hitting the curb
horn broken watch for finger
heavily armed easily pissed
We The People Are Pissed Off
my other car is a broom
will you shut up, man
If You're Gonna Ride My Ass, at Least Pull My Hair!
on my way to get a lobotomy
i'm not drunk i'm passing out snacks
don't honk at me i'm sensitive
god bless the whole world no exceptions
heaven and hell
police lives matter
dog is my co-pilot
no farms no food
impeach joe biden
navy girlfriend
love is greater than fear
only gay cops pull me over
granny on board
autism awareness
show me your kitties
love animals eat plants
eat beef the west wasnt won on salad
do not tailgate
make america think again
