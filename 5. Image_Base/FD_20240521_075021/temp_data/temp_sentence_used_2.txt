to Avoid Injury Don't Tell Me How to Do My Job
Remember Stupid You Have to Drive This Home
We Are All Broken, That's How The Light Gets In
You're So Close You Might as Well Get in
Please Do Not Disturb
I'm Not Lazy I'm on My Energy Saving Mode
If you can read this my girlfriend says you're to close
If you love me read me a book
If You Are Reading This It Is Too Lates
I'm not ignoring you, i'm just reading
I'm not ignoring you, I'm processing
I'm NOT IGNORING YOU, I'M MULTITASKING
I'm not ignoring you, I'm just checking my phone
I'm not busy, I just don't like you
I'm Not Yelling, I'm Projecting
In my Defense, I was Unsupervised
In My Defense, I wasn't Listening
In my defense the moon was full
In My Defense My Wife Left Me Unsupervised
If you are reading this, you are too close
if you can read this bring me coffee
More Love Less Hate
I'm Not Gay But My Butthole Is
Remember Why You Started
I can't fix stupid but I can cuff it
If You Can't Fix It Duct It!
I'm Not Ignoring You, I'm Deaf
I'm Not Ignoring You, I Have a Hearing Loss
yes I'm Ignoring You
I'm not ignoring you, I just don't like you
I'm A Dad And A Engineer
I'm not deaf, I'm just ignoring you
I'm Not Ignoring You, I Have Autism
I’m not ignoring you, I’m on power-saving mode
I'm not ignoring you, I’m just really busy
I’m not ignoring you, I’m just Deaf
I'm not ignoring you, I'm hard of hearing
