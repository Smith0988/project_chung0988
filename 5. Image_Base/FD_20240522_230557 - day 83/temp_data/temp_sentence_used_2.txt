Live a Great Story
This Is A Safe Space To Be Who You
I Still Read Fairytales They're Just Spicier Now
I Do Believe Its Time for Another Adventure
Remember Your Why
When i die i may not go to heaven
I fully intend to haunt people when I die
When I Die My Fish Gets Everything
I May Not Be Perfect
When I Die Don't Let Me Vote Republican
water my plants when I die
I Cry When Fictional Characters Die
I fully intend to haunt teachers when i die
We're All Going To Die
i fully intend to hunt people when i die
When I Die The Cat Gets Everything
when i die don't let me vote
Keep Talking I'm Diagnosing You
I'm Not A Regular MOM, I'm A Cool MOM!
I'm Not Always A Bitch Just Kidding Go Fuck Yourself
I Run On Coffee, Sarcasm and Lipstick
REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A GAME
Women belong in all places
I Became A Nurse For The Money And Fame
You're In My World Now Grandma
Don't Be the Bunny
Asexual Pirates are not Interested in your Booty
donâ€™t worry about it, sweetheart
Make it simple, but significant
It's a beautiful day for accounting
I'm Busy Reading Fantasy Books
Sorrows, Sorrows, Prayers.
In my defense, I work in marketing
Follow The Yellow Brick Road
Safe Space To Be Who You Are
Ice Cream Will Fix It
Take the Road Less Traveled On
Go Ahead Make My Day
Home is Behind The World Ahead
The sun will rise and we will try again
There is no sunshine, only darkness
When you know better, do better
Lose Your Mind Find Your Soul
cool cool cool no doubt no doubt
The Bravest Thing You Can be is yourself
A Little Dirt Never Hurt
When I Die don't let me Vote Democrat
When I Die The Dog Gets Everything
