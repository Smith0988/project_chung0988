I'm Not A Regular MOM, I'm A Cool MOM!
I'm Not Always A Bitch Just Kidding Go Fuck Yourself
I Run On Coffee, Sarcasm and Lipstick
REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A GAME
Discovering The Truth About Ourselves
I'm looking to share in an adventure
Women belong in all places
I Became A Nurse For The Money And Fame
You're In My World Now Grandma
Don't Be the Bunny
Dreams Come True, Yeah They Do
Stars. Can't do it. Not today.
I'm in the depths of despair
Asexual Pirates are not Interested in your Booty
don’t worry about it, sweetheart
Make it simple, but significant
It's a beautiful day for accounting
I'm Busy Reading Fantasy Books
Sorrows, Sorrows, Prayers.
Pain and Panic Reporting for Duty
In my defense, I work in marketing
Follow The Yellow Brick Road
Who will tell the story of your life?
for you, a thousand times over
You could eat another bite
Safe Space To Be Who You Are
This Is Our Fucking City
Don't Burn The Day Away
Be Careful, I’m A Lawyer
Ice Cream Will Fix It
Take the Road Less Traveled On
i just need your name
Do Not Come Crying to Me
Go Ahead Make My Day
'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
Home is Behind The World Ahead
This is me trying
I Didn't Expect to Survive
The sun will rise and we will try again
There is no sunshine, only darkness
In the end, it doesnt even matter
the marks they leave behind
Dont just stare at it, eat it.
When you know better, do better
Lose Your Mind Find Your Soul
cool cool cool no doubt no doubt
Oh What a Beautiful Morning
It's A Bit Nipply Out
I saw nothing but beauty
The Bravest Thing You Can be is yourself
A Little Dirt Never Hurt
When I Die don't let me Vote Democrat
When I Die The Dog Gets Everything
