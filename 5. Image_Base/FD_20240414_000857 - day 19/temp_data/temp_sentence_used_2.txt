Free Rides for Goth Girls
Because She is My Daughter
I Support Police
Shit Happens
I Make Shit Happen
Shit Happens Shake IT Off
Shit Happens Mostly To Me, so don't worry.
Let The Shit go
Shit happens Just be happy
Don't Touch My Shit
Get Out of Your Own Way and Make Shit Happen
This is My Circus These are My Monkeys
Awake not Woke
I'm Not Totally Useless i can be used as a bad example!
If I Wasn't a Good Electrician I Would be Dead by Now
I'm Here to Fuck Shit Up
i'm jacked up on mountain dew
I'm Confused Baby in a Topless bar
It's Just a Flesh Wound
you're a bad driver But did You die?
DO OR DO NOT There is NO Try
keep calm all bleeding stops eventually
I Work Harder Than an Ugly Stripper
Nobody Cares Swim Faster
Work Hard play harder
The Truth is Still Out There
I Have No Idea What I'm Doing
This is The Way
Jesus: The Way. The Truth. The Life
My Broom is in The Shop
I Do Believe Its Time for Another Adventure ture
Yes, This is My Truck. No, I Won't Help You Move
I'm Fine It's Just My Face
My Other Broom is A Car
My Other Car is A Broomstick
My Other Ride is a Broom
My Other Motorcycle is A Broom
I'm Going On an Adventure
It's Time for Another Adventure
I'm Nicer Than My Face Looks
Don't Worry I Know What I'm Doing
Hold On Let Me Overthink This
You're insecure
Speak Your Mind Even If Your Voice Shakes
Fight for Those Without Your Privilege
Do You Follow Jesus This Close?
Please Be Patient, I'm Actually Three Dogs in a Trench Coat
Just So We're Clear I Ain't Giving Up Shit
Keep Calm Winter is Coming
It's Lights Out and Away We Go
