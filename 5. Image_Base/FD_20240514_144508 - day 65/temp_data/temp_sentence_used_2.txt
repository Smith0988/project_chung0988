Don't Park Too Close I'm Thick
I Brake for Cats
I Brake for dogs
I Brake for Butterflies
I Brake for Wildlife
I Support Single Moms
I Brake for Tailgaters
I Brake for Bunnies
I Brake for Ducks
Easily Distracted by Cows
That Sounds Like A You Problem
Embrace the Chaos
You've Yee'd Your Last Haw
Hang in There It Get Worse
Please Let Me Merge Before I Start Crying
The Hell I Won't
Thats My Purse, I Don't Know You
Heaven Won't Have ME Hell's Afraid I'll TAKE Over
I'm Going to Hell On A Full Scholarship
My Other Car is A Sled Pulled by 58 Possums
Surviving Purely Out of Spite
God Is Testing Me And I Have Not Studied
