I Hate People
Stand for The Flag Kneel for The Fallen
Not All Who Wander are Lost
My Spirit Animal is Bigfoot
Objects in Mirror are Losing
And Into The Forest I Go To Lose My Mind And Find My Soul
the Truth is Out There
Believe There is Good in The World
Please Wipe Your Feet
Seat Belts Must Be Worn In This Vehicle
