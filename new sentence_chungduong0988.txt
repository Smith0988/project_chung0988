I Came, I Saw, I Had Anxiety, So I Left
I Identify As A American 
I'm Only Driving This Way to Piss You Off
I'm Retired, Go Around Me
I'm Only Driving Fast Because I Have to Poop
I'm Speeding Because I Have to Poop
If You Don't Like The Way I Drive Stay Off The Sidewalk
Think This is Slow Wait Until I Go Uphill
My Driving Scares Me Too
We The People are Pissed Off 
Outta My Way I Have to Pee!
I Love Peeing Outside
I Piss Stupid People Off
I Smell Commies!
I Paused My Crime Show for This
Probably Listening to a True Crime Podcast
I'm Watching Serial Killer Crime Show Documentaries
I Paused My Game to be here
Id Rather Be Watching Crime Shows
I need a nap 
I Don't Need A Valentine I need a nap 
All I Need is Coffee and My Dog
There It Goes My Last Flying Fuck
It's NOT Going to Suck Itself
If You're Going to Ride My Ass Don't Forget to Kiss It
Lets Keep The Dumbfuckery to a Minimum Today
Smash The Patriarchy 
Carry Yourself with The Confidence of A Mediocre White Man
I don't rise and shine, I caffeinate and hope for the best
It's Fine. I'm Fine. Everything is Fine
The Strongest Steel is Forged in The Fire of a Dumpster
I'm Silently Judging Your Teeth
My Sense of Humor Might Hurt Your Feelings
Well, If It Isn't The Consequences of My Own Actions
